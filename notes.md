# NOTES

## How long did it take?

- ?

## Overview

- Restructured project folders to seperate stateless and stateful components
- Refactored JSX structure, created seperate component for New Appiontmnet and added basic layout structure


You should:
- provide an overview of how you approached this challenge
- explain any trade-offs you made here, for example if you decided to take less time on the styling so you could concentrate on tests
- explain what you would have done next, for example you might decide to write more tests or spend more time on styling

## General Feedback

- Is there anything we need to improve or make clearer?
